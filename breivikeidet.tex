\section{Introduction}

Planetary boundary layer (PBL) is located at the lowest part of the atmosphere, but that does not make it a boring subject to study. In fact, due to its location, it is home to variety of different physics mechanisms (e.g. convection, turbulence) and makes PBL one of the most exciting and challenging parts of the atmosphere to study. The majority of the weather patterns we observe every day are either the direct (e.g. inversion) or indirect (e.g. ) result of PBL. Therefore, a better understanding of PBL is of crucial importance in weather prediction studies. 

Height of the PBL is an important factor in defining the PBL. However, it has/is (been)/ found that PBL has no fixed and exact height and it can vary up to several kilometers in a matter of a few hours (in unstable atmosphere conditions) [source]. Generally, PBL is defined as the part of the atmosphere where the Earth's surface and atmosphere meet and interact (exchange physics) up to the height where these interactions are carried and felt by the atmosphere [Pleim2007b]. Along with height of the PBL, stability of the PBL is of special interest amongst meteorologists and climatologists. Stability status of the PBL can tell us about the buoyancy condition of the atmosphere and the possible related phenomena (e.g. inversion).

The aim of this work is to study the PBL of the Breivikeidet valley (location) and to find the relation between different physical parameters (mainly temperature, potential temperature, water vapor and wind velocity components with height) in the PBL over a course of 16 days (i.e. from March 10, 2016 to March 25, 2016). The investigated day were chosen in a way that a transition from warm weather to cold weather can be captured in order to study the behavior of the PBL at such weather transition. This work has made extensive use of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model [source].

In chapter 2 a short theoretical background of the work is given. Chapter 3 focuses on the WRF settings. Chapter 4 and 5 present the result and discussion of the results respectively. Finally, Chapter 6 gives a short conclusion of the results.

\section{Theoretical Background}

In the following section a short overview of the investigated parameters along with the important equations that were used to find the value of those parameters is given.

\subsection{Temperature}

Probably temperature is the most important parameter in PBL since any change in temperature can have immediate impact on the other parameters of the PBL. Therefore, a close attention was paid to temperature behavior in this study. In order to have a better view of the temperature evolution throughout the PBL, an attempt was made to investigate temperature behavior not only from the height-change perspective but also from radiation balance of the surface and radiative flux divergence views. 

\subsubsection{Radiation Balance}

Generally, the radiation in the PBL is PBL is highly effected by the radiation balance of the surface ground specially during daytime. Radiation balance in its simplest form considers the balance between the absorption and radiation of the ground at its surface as is stated by the eq.\ref{eq:1}.

\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{equation}
R_N = R_{s\downarrow} + R_{s\uparrow} + R_{L\downarrow} + R_{L\uparrow}
\end{equation}
\vspace{0.25cm}

Where the $R_N$ is the net radiation at the surface, $R_{s\downarrow}$ and $R_{L\downarrow}$ are the incoming short and longwave radiation at the surface and $R_{s\uparrow}$ and $R_{L\uparrow}$ are the short and long wave radiation from the ground respectively. It has to be noted that the $R_{s\uparrow}$ is the partial reflection of the $R_{s\downarrow}$ by the surface. The net radiation absorbed and radiated, at all wavelengths, by the ground during a sufficiently long enough period will be zero (or very close to). 

Generally, during daytime shortwave from the sun is dominant and right after the sunset the longwave radiation of the ground will be dominant with their peak wavelength at $6000$ $K$ and $287$ $K$ for short and long wave radiation respectively (see Fig? and ? of the book Arya). During daytime the surface ground will warm up by absorbing the incoming shortwave radiation. At layers very close to the surface ($\sim 1 mm$) the generated heat by the ground will be transfered to the ambient air during what is called sensible heat transfer mechanism. Above that layer, the heat transfer process will be in a convective manner. This convection in turn will generate turbulence and results in vertical mixing of the PBL. As the sunset arrives, the ground will start to cool off by radiating in longwave radiation. And as a result, turbulence will slow down and the vertical mixing will weaken throughout the PBL.

\subsubsection{Radiative Flux Divergence}

Although radiation balance can give a simplified picture of what happens at the lowest part of the PBL close to the surface, it is not the complete picture. The concept of net radiative flux divergence/convergence is another tool that can help us to build a better picture of the influence of the radiation on different layers of air in the PBL at different heights. The rate of cooling or warming of a layer of air due to net radiation at PBL can be measured using the conservation of energy principle. Assuming a layer of air in PBL confined to a height of $z$ to $z$ $+$ $dz$, the cooling or warming rate of this layer of air due to net radiation effect can be found using the following equation: 

\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{equation}
\Big(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\Big)_R = \Big(\frac{1}{\rho c_p}\Big)\Big(\frac{\partial R_N}{\partial z}\Big)
\end{equation}
\vspace{0.25cm}

Where $\Big(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\Big)_R$ is the rate of cooling/warming of an specific layer of air in PBL, $\Big(\frac{\partial R_N}{\partial z}\Big)$ $<$ 0 is the convergence rate of net radiation at height $z$ and results in air warming off and $\Big(\frac{\partial R_N}{\partial z}\Big)$ $>$ 0 is the divergence rate of net radiation at height $z$ and results in air cooling off (see fig).

Several studies have found that the contribution of the shortwave radiation to the net radiative flux divergence/convergence is quite insignificant and vertical shortwave radiative heating is nearly equally distributed in the surface boundary layer (phd and references therein). On the other hand, the longwave radiative flux is highly height dependent and strongly influences the air layers in the PBL. This study will focus on the effect of the net longwave radiation on PBL at different heights.

\subsubsection{Mixing Ratio, Saturated Mixing Ratio, Relative Humidity, and Dew Point Temperature}

Mixing ratio, $w$, is one of the wrf's outputs. It is defined as the mass of the water vapor (in gram) to the mass of the dry air (in kilogram). However, mixing ratio alone may not provide a clear picture on humidity of the PBL. To have a clearer view, one can use relative humidity (RH) as a tracer of mixing ratio, saturation mixing ratio, and dew point temperature, $T_{dp}$, in the PBL. Also, it can be used to trace precipitation in the atmosphere. As an air parcel rises in the atmosphere the water vapor content of the parcel approaches its dew point. (the temperature below which water vapor goes through a phase transition and condenses into water.) However, before that it the water vapor in the parcel reaches its saturation limit. It is defined as the limit where the water evaporation rate is equal to the water condensation rate. At this point the water vapor pressure of the parcel can be estimated using eq.\ref{eq:?}[paper refe]. 

\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
e_s = [1.0007 + (3.46 \times 10^{-6} P)] \times 6.1121 \: exp\Big(\frac{17.502\; T}{240.97 + T}\Big)
\end{equation}
\vspace{0.25cm}

Where $e_s$ is water vapor pressure in $hPa$, $P$ is pressure in $hPa$, and $T$ temperature in degree Celsius $^\circ C$.
Once water vapor pressure is know the saturation mixing ratio at each temperature and height can be found from the following equation:

\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
w_s = 0.622 \: \frac{e_s}{P - e_s}
\end{equation}
\vspace{0.25cm}

Where $w_s$ is the saturation mixing ratio, $P$ is pressure at each height, and $e_s$ is the water vapor ratio from eq.\ref{eq:3}. Once we have mixing ratio and saturation mixing ratio, relative humidity (RH) can be easily found from the following equation:

\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{equation}
RH\equiv\frac{w}{w_s}
\end{equation}
\vspace{0.25cm}

Where $w$ and $w_s$ are mixing ratio and saturated mixing ratio respectively. Finally, the dew point temperature can be found using Arden Buck equation (refe).

\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{equation}
T_{dp} = \frac{c\gamma_m(T,RH)}{b - \gamma_m (T,RH)}
\end{equation}

where,

\begin{equation}
\gamma_m(T,RH) = ln\Bigg(\frac{RH}{100}\: exp\Big(\Big(b - \frac{T}{d}\Big)\Big(\frac{T}{c+T}\Big)\Big)\Bigg)
\end{equation}

\vspace{0.25cm}

with the following set of constants,
\begin{equation*}
(a = 6.1121\: \text{millibar;} \quad b = 18.678; \quad c = 257.14 \:^\circ C; \quad d = 234.5 \: ^\circ C)
\end{equation*}

\vspace{0.25cm}

With the above set of constants the results of the eq 2.6 will have a maximum error of $1\: \%$. However, in has to be mentioned that there are other sets of constants with lesser degree of errors but limited to a certain range of temperatures. A comparison between temperature, dew point, and humidity can give us clue as to what parts of PBL has gone through precipitation.


\subsection{Potential Temperature}

Potential temperature ($\Theta$) is probably the most interesting parameter in this study. Potential temperature is defined as the temperature that an air parcel would have if it is brought back to a reference pressure level adiabatically.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
\Theta = T(\frac{P_R}{P})^K
\end{equation}

\vspace{0.5cm}

In equation \ref{eq:1} $P_R$ is the reference pressure level and usually replaced by $1000$ (pressure at sea level and in mbar). P and T are pressure and temperature of the ambient environment at some point in the atmosphere. Also, $K$ is the Kappa exponent and, for dry air, it is $K = \frac{R}{C_P}\cong 0.286$.

The importance of potential temperature comes from the fact that it is not affected by the physical ascending or descending of an air parcel (unlike actual temperature). Potential temperature is a measure of stratification of the atmosphere which in turn is a measure of stability. In other words, potential temperature is a measure of the resistivity of the atmosphere to the vertical motion of an air parcel. Depending how resistant the atmosphere is, potential temperature can be positive ($\Theta > 0$), neutral ($\Theta = 0$) or negative ($\Theta < 0$). If an air parcel is released and given an initial push (toward higher altitudes) in an atmosphere with positive potential temperature, the vertical motion of the air parcel will be suppressed and it will be pushed back to its initial location. Such resistant atmosphere is called an stably stratified atmosphere. In such atmosphere the actual temperature of the ambient is higher than that of the air parcel. As a result of this temperature difference and following the Buoyancy acceleration (eq. \ref{eq:2}) a downward force will act upon the air parcel.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
a_b = g\bigg(\frac{T_p - T_a}{T_a}\bigg)
\end{equation}

\vspace{0.25cm}

Where $a_b$ is the buoyancy acceleration, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $T_p$ and $T_a$ are the actual temperature of the air parcel and atmosphere respectively. If potential temperature increases with height, it is a sign that the air parcel is entering a stable atmosphere. On the other hand, if the air parcel, on its way to higher altitudes, experiences a temperature difference in a way that the temperature inside the parcel is higher than the ambient temperature of the atmosphere, the buoyancy force will be upward and air parcel will keep rising toward even higher altitudes. An atmosphere in which an air parcel can travel toward higher altitudes is called an unstably stratified atmosphere. If an air parcel is located in some part of the atmosphere where there is no temperature difference between the air parcel and the ambient atmosphere no buoyancy force will act upon the air parcel and it will not move. Such atmosphere is called a neutral atmosphere.

\section{Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model}

Weather Research and Forecast (WRF)\footnote{http://www.wrf-model.org} is a numerical weather model that is mainly used for weather research and forecast purposes. 
For the purpose this work WRF model version 3.8 (the latest version at the time of writing this report) was used. Below, different parameters of the WRF model that were used in this work are explained shortly, but the reader is encouraged to see [tor] and [WRF user] for a detailed discussion of the choice of different parameters used in WRF model. Also, appendix ... shows the choice of different parameters for the purpose of this work in the form of a namelist.input file. 

%\subsection{General Structure of WRF}
%WRF is a Gudnov based model. Explain i,j and k also the middle of the cell %parameters.

\subsection{WRF settings}
Generally, settings in the WRF model can be divided into ... categories where we shortly discuss some of them in the following.

\subsubsection{Domains and Dimensions}
For the purpose of this study a three-nested-domain model was used with the following grid points length; domain one (i.e. the outermost domain) $dx = 18000$ $m$, domain two (i.e. middle domain) $dx = 6000$ $m$, and third domain (i.e. the inner most domain with finest resolution) $dx = 2000$ $m$. The model covers an area from long lat ... with nn and mm grid points in x and y direction respectively. Also, at each grid point, fifty cells are stacked on top of one another. This way WRF model will calculate some of the parameters (e.g. potential temperature, humidity) at fifty different heights.

\subsubsection{Time Step}
WRF model is based on a 3rd order Runge-Kutta integration [53]. Therefore, time step is one of the core parameters of this model and special attention has to be paid to selecting the right time step. A very small time step can be computationally very expensive and a very big time step can cause an early divergence which in turn causes the simulation to crash. In order to find the appropriate value for the time step the Courant-Fredrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition and maximum Courant number by  was followed [21]. They introduced a minimum and maximum value for the time step (eq. 3.1) based on which the value of $dt$ should be confined to a certain interval.
\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{equation}
t = ...
\end{equation}

\vspace{0.25cm}

Finally, after several test runs the value of $dt$ $=$ $60$ seconds was chosen as the value of the time step.

\section{Discussion}

The purpose of this chapter is to study the behavior and evolution of mixing ratio (q), potential temperature ($\Theta$), temperature (T), and wind in the PBL throughout a day at Breivikeidet. Also, the study was restricted to the lowest $\sim$ 900 $m$ of the atmosphere.

Some of the plots and some of the physical parameters show a peculiar behavior at midnight time (00:00). A further analysis of the feature is presented at the end of this chapter (see ?) as to whether this feature is a computational artifact or it, truly, is the behavior of the PBL at this time of the day. However, to avoid the risk of miss-interpretation of the data, the behavior of the parameters at this time of the day will not be discussed.

\subsection{Where is Breivikeidet?}

The Breivikeidet is located at 19.43 longitude and 69.63 latitude. It is located in a valley surrounded by mountains from northeastern and southeastern directions. The set of coordinates used in this study belong to a location in this valley as shown in Fig.\ref{location}. The purpose of this choice was to capture the behavior of PBL in this valley.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Choice of Days}
In order to keep this report short only two days of the sixteen days were studied, but a complete list of figures of all days can be found in appendix ?. The two days are March \ordinalnum{15}, and \ordinalnum{23}. The reason behind this choice is to study the behavior of PBL of the warmest, and coldest. Fig. \ref{warmcold}, shows a plot of the maximum, minimum and the average temperature profile of all days.

\subsection{The Warmest Day (March 15, 2016)}

This day is the warmest day among all the sixteens day. It is preceded by another warm day and followed by a cold (the transition day; see Fig. \ref{warmcold}).

\subsubsection{Temperature}

Below is the evolution plot of the physical parameters at March 15 (Fig. \ref{march15}).

\begin{figure}[bhp]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/home/ubuntu/nozhan/science/tromuni/semester/s17/individual/report/pics/march15.png}

In the far right-hand plot the solid bright green line shows the average of the net wind in the horizontal plane along with variations of wind components U and V. (Notice the distinctive dashed-green line at potential temperature and temperature plots at 00:00.)}
\label{march15}
\end{figure}

\vspace{1cm}

Clearly temperature drops at higher altitudes with no deflection at higher altitudes. It is evident that the PBL is quite stable up to $\sim$ 900 $m$ at at this day. However, a closer look, shows a slight divergence of temperature from the average value at 03:00 and 06:00. This divergence at early hours of the day can be a sign of presence of an inversion layer (although given the height at which this feature is observed, it is less likely that this layer is an inversion layer).The other possibility is the presence of cloud or cloud formation at this height (see 4.3.2 for more details). 

Temperature does not show strong diurnal variation throughout the day (about 1 $K$ at lowest and $\sim$ 2 $K$ at 800 $m$). Vegetation, moisture, clouds, and strong winds all can contribute to the suppression of diurnal temperature variability. Considering the fact that Breivikeidet is predominantly covered with different types of vegetation and looking at water vapor, and wind velocity ($\sim$ 15.5 $m/s$) during this day it is highly probable that the low temperature variation is suppressed due to these factors [Ariya 1983, Fig. 5.7]. Also, there are signs that this day must have been a cloudy day (see below for further details) which in turn contributes to the suppression of temperature variation during.

%From the surface to 100 $\sim$ $m$ the temperature profile appears to be constant at different hours of the day. The possible explanation for this behavior could be that as the sun insolation heats the ground in the morning it starts heating up the surface. The generated heat from the surface causes vertical convection which in turn results in vertical mixing of the air layers in PBL up to $\sim$ 100 $m$. However, looking at fig.? it is clear that the surface temperature does not vary much (mostly constant) during the day. Also, the 2 $m$ temperature profile shows an almost constant decrease with time during the day. It suggests that there is not much convection going on above the ground. This makes it hard for the heat convection mechanism to be the possible reason behind the observed constant temperature in the PBL. Another possible explanation could be mechanically generated turbulent as a result of wind friction by the surface and the resulting wind shear through the PBL (see section ... for more details). Looking at Fig.?? (i.e. the wind plot) and the wind velocity at different hours of the day, it is possible that the mechanically generated turbulence are the reason behind the homogeneous temperature profile in the lower part of the PBL by mixing air layers at within this height. Nevertheless, wind generated turbulence is weaker than heat-convection generated turbulence and it may be the reason that we do not see the homogeneity in temperature profile at higher than $\sim$ 100 $m$ altitudes. However, it is also possible that a combination of heat convection and mechanical mixing (or a third unnoticed mechanism) is the possible reason behind the nearly constant temperature profile within lowest $\sim$ 100 $m$ of PBL.

It might be of interest to see how the energy budget of the surface changes during this day. Fig. \ref{budget15} shows the energy budget profile of the surface skin at March 15.

\vspace{0.35cm}

\begin{figure}[bhp]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/home/ubuntu/nozhan/science/tromuni/semester/s17/individual/report/pics/budget15.png}
\caption{The energy budget of the surface at March 15. Solid lines show the radiation of short and longwave radiation from the sky to the surface and dashed lines show the radiation from ground to the skies. The black solid line shows the net energy budget of the ground during this day.}
\label{budget15}
\end{figure}

\vspace{1cm}

There are several notable features in this plot. The bump in the middle of the day, greater-than-shortwave incoming longwave in the middle of the day, and several troughs in the incoming longwave radiation towards the end of the day.

In a day with clear skies the incoming shortwave is by far stronger than the incoming longwave radiation (see ... for more details). However, in this plot the incoming longwave radiation is stronger. Presence of clouds could be a possible explanation for this pattern. Possibly clouds have absorbed part of the incoming shortwave radiation and re-emitted in longwave radiation. Also, part of the incoming shortwave has been reflected by the clouds. These two factors cause the strong incoming longwave and the weaker shortwave radiation. As previously stated, there are several periods at which the incoming longwave radiation undergoes a sudden decrease along with a slight increase in the incoming shortwave radiation (e.g. 08:00, 16:00) with the longwave radiation still the dominant incoming radiation. It is possible that at these hours the sky has cleared (or at least clouds have thinned out) for several minuets. With less/no clouds in the way there will be less absorption (and re-emission in infrared) and less reflection of the shortwave radiation. As a result, an increase and decrease in the incoming short and longwave radiation occurs respectively. Also, it has to be noted that since the shortwave radiation is not the dominant radiation at these time intervals, it may well be that the sunlight does not hit the surface directly (supporting the cloud thinning scenario).

On the outgoing radiation side, the outgoing shortwave radiation is a fraction of the incoming shortwave radiation\footnote{The WRF simulation does not output the outgoing shortwave radiation but it does output the albedo. The $S_{\uparrow} = (1 - a)\: S_{\downarrow}$ was used to find the outgoing shortwave radiation where $a$ is the albedo.} depending on the value of albedo of the surface at each hour. Both incoming and outgoing shortwave radiations drop to zero after sunset. At night the surface cooling starts. The surface tries to get rid of the energy that has absorbed during the day by radiating it away at infrared\footnote{Longwave radiation ($L_{\uparrow}$), also, is not provided by the WRF. The surface skin temperature was used to find the $L_{\uparrow}$ using Stefan-Boltzmann equation ($R = \sigma \: T^4$).}. 

Finally, the black line shows the net energy budget of the surface during March 15. As expected, in the middle of the day the energy budget of the surface raises towards positive values a sign that the surface is receiving more energy than it is emitting and the surface temperature rises. As the sunset approaches the energy budget of the surface moves towards negative values a meaning that the surface is loosing more energy than it receives a sign that the surface is cooling.

To test whether change in energy budget of the surface effects the temperature of the surface a plot of surface skin temperature variation with time and water vapor (at 2m) is shown (Fig. \ref{skinvapor15}). 

\vspace{1cm}

\begin{figure}[bhp]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/home/ubuntu/nozhan/science/tromuni/semester/s17/individual/report/pics/skinvapor15.png}
\caption{The blue and red lines show the water vapor at 2m and surface skin temperature respectively during March 15.}
\label{skinvapor15}
\end{figure}

\vspace{1cm}

Unlike what the energy budget from Fig. \ref{budget15} suggests there is no increase in temperature in the middle of the day. It is possible that any increase in temperature is used for evaporation of water on the surface. However, since water vapor decreases towards the end of the day, one expects an increase in temperature, but such increase is not observed. As discussed before the two troughs may be the result of clouds thinning out (or clouds clearing the sky for several minutes) and the peak in the middle signals a cloudy period. Given the fact that there is one peak in the middle of the two troughs, it is unlikely that this pattern (at the end of the day) is the result of heat absorption by the water on the surface.

\subsubsection{Mixing Ratio, Saturated Mixing Ratio, Relative Humidity, and Dew point}

The initial analysis of the mixing ratio $q$ is similar to temperature. Mixing ratio decreases with time at all altitudes and the diurnal variation of the mixing ratio is quite low. This is not surprising since the diurnal variation of mixing ratio depends on the diurnal variation of temperature (see section 4.3.1 for more details on temperature variation). 

\begin{figure}[bhp]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/home/ubuntu/nozhan/science/tromuni/semester/s17/individual/report/pics/humidity15.png}
\caption{Similar to Fig. \ref{march15} dashed line show the variation of physical parameters at different hours and solid black line shows the average value. Notice that the relative humidity is given in $\%$.}
\label{humidity15}
\end{figure}

However, at 06:00 there is a shift in mixing ratio towards lower values around 700 $m$ height (Fig. \ref{march15}). Looking at temperature and potential temperature plots around the same height a sudden increase is noticeable. In order to investigate this feature more the procedure in 2.1.3 was followed to find relative humidity ($RH$) and dew point temperature ($T_{dp}$). Fig. \ref{humidity15} shows an evolution graph of mixing ratio, relative humidity, temperature and dew point. 

The strong and sudden divergence of $RH$ towards lower values is visible around $700$ $m$. Also, convergence of $RH$ at different heights, toward 100 $\%$ is another noticeable feature of RH plot. The convergence behavior of RH can be a sign of presence of lifting condensation level (LCL)\footnote{Lifting condensation level (LCL) is the height up to which an air parcel's temperature will decrease under adiabatic lapse rate and once it reaches this level the air parcel will have $RH$ of 100 $\%$.} at different heights and at different hours of the day. Considering the change in $RH$, potential temperature, temperature, and dew point at 06:00 it is possible that at this hour and around this height a cloud formation process (and possibly some precipitation) has occurred. The air in PBL at this hour has reached the LCL and moved above this level. Further lifting results in temperature decreases further and below the dew point. This results in water to go through a phase transition by releasing latent heat in the atmosphere. As result of this heat release the water vapor condenses into liquid water and forms clouds. As more air is lifted more clouds are produced and as clouds are lifted up further, liquid water may fall out of clouds. This will probably explain the strong decrease in humidity in Fig. \ref{humidity15} at 06:00. Another effect of the release of latent heat in the atmosphere is increase in ambient temperature at this height which explains the slight increase in the temperature seen in Fig. \ref{march15}. Also, once air reaches its saturation limit above the LCL it no longer follows the adiabatic lapse rate, but it follows the saturated adiabatic lapse rate. This is probably the reason we observe a slight divergence of potential temperature toward higher values. To test this scenario the data from the Tromsdalen observation station was checked. It appears that there has been a period of precipitation in the amounts of 0.2 $mm$ and 0.1 $mm$ at 06:00 and 07:00 respectively in the morning of the March 15.
 
\subsubsection{Potential Temperature}

All in all, potential temperature during March 15 seems to be stable throughout the atmosphere up to $\sim$ 800 $m$ (see Fig. \ref{march15}). Any adiabatic lifting or sinking of an air parcel will be suppressed by the atmosphere (see eq. 2.9). Despite possible wind-induced and heat-induced turbulence during the day (specially mid day), these turbulences are not strong enough to mix the PBL at any height.

\subsubsection{Wind}

Wind velocity profile is shown in Fig. \ref{march15}. A noticeable feature in wind profile is the small variation of the wind velocity at different hours of the day. In a day with clear skies, it is expected that under clear skies wind velocity decreases in the middle of the day due to heat-induced turbulence from the ground. However, since March 15 is most likely, a cloudy day (see section 4.3.1 for more details) the heat-induced turbulences (if there are any) are not strong enough to weaken wind velocity. 

The other feature of the wind profile is the increase of wind velocity at higher altitudes. Friction force and air density are the possible explanation for this behavior. Closer to surface wind faces a strong friction force as it interacts with the surface and the object on the surface. However, at higher altitudes, where there is no obstacle to face, the wind velocity increases. Also, at higher altitudes density of air decreases (as result of decrease in pressure). And lower density makes it easier for the air to move around.

Looking closely at the wind components it is clear that the U component of the wind increases substantially with height to the point where it reaches nearly three times its value close to the surface. On the other hand, the V component does not vary significantly with height and unlike the U component it actually decreases with height.

\subsubsection{Computational Artifact or Natural Behavior?}

As it was mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, in some of the figures (e.g. Fig.) at the time 00:00 most of the parameters show a peculiar behavior that is not seen at other times of the day. Thus, it was decided to exclude this time interval from the discussion part. However, it is of special interest as to correctly recognize whether this behavior is a computational artifact or the natural behavior of those physical parameters at that time. 

Below is a graph of the ... (see Fig.?). There are several differences between this graph and the other ones. The first and most important difference is the time interval used to make this plot. Unlike other figures, the physical parameters in this graph are plotted at ten-minute intervals (the smallest possible interval for the outputs of this simulation; see ... for more details) both before and after midnight hour. The aim was to test whether this behavior happens at 00:00 and then gradually converges towards later values or it happens at 00:00 and then suddenly jumps to the later values. The former behavior means it is a sign that this is the natural behavior of the physical parameter. However, if the latter is true it is highly probable that this behavior is a computational artifact. From the graph it is clear that there is sudden jump from 00:00 to later values that support the computational artifact.

It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned behavior is not very noticeable at all days (weak at 14 and 20 but strong at 21 and 22 of March). Also, it appears that potential temperature and, accordingly, temperature are the parameters that suffer the most compared to mixing ratio.

It is of crucial importance to know what causes this behavior but it is out of the scope of this study. However, domain decoupling could be a possible candidate for this behavior that can be further investigated.
